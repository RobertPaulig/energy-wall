# Solving the AI Energy Wall: Coherent Non‑Filamentary Memory

**Problem**: Filamentary RRAM (HfO₂) has a stochastic noise floor (RTN) that blocks true analog scaling and burns energy via Joule/ion motion.

**Solution**: A **coherent phase** (CDW, e.g., 1T‑TaS₂) with **resonant control** — non‑filamentary, low‑noise, fast, and energy‑minimal.

**Simulation (MNIST)**: run both physics modes and plot accuracy vs energy.

**KPI (PoC target)**: ENOB ≥ 8; NL < 2% on 256 steps; σ/μ < 0.1%/h @ 85 °C; write < 1 ns; read < 100 ps; energy/step < 10 fJ/µm²; endurance > 1e12; retention > 10 years; **no filaments; no RTN**.

**Ask**: Partner for lab PoC (not MPW). Budget –, 12–18 weeks.
